The value of the global meat sector was estimated to value at 897 billion U.S. dollars in 2021, and was forecast to increase to 1354 billion U.S. dollars by 2027.
Global meat industry
The production volume of meat worldwide has seen a slight increase between 2016 and 2020, from 317.2 million metric tons to around 328 million metric tons. During that time period, pork and poultry were the two most produced types of meat in terms of weight. In 2016 and 2017 pork had a slightly larger production volume than poultry but between 2017 and 2020, poultry overtook pork as the leading of meat worldwide.
Beef in the United States
The United States is the world’s leading producer of beef and veal as of 2020. In that year, the U.S.’s beef production amounted to 12.4 million metric tons. The United States also has the largest domestic consumption of beef of any country. On a regional level, the amount that each consumer in the United States spends on beef on an annual basis varies quite significantly, with the Western United States having the highest household expenditure on beef, and the Midwest having the lowest.
I think too much meat consumption is not good(we should not exagerate!), but too little is not good either.
